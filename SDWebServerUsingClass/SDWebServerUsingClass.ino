  Have a FAT Formatted SD Card connected to the SPI port of the ESP8266
  The web root is the SD Card root folder
  File extensions with more than 3 charecters are not supported by the SD Library
  File Names longer than 8 charecters will be truncated by the SD library, so keep filenames shorter
  index.htm is the default index (works on subfolders as well)

  upload the contents of SdRoot to the root of the SDcard and access the editor by going to http://esp8266sd.local/edit
